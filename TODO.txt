    - build road on path of haulers and upgraders (they should put down construction sites)
    - or, take path from algo and plot roads on that
    - or build roads based on calculated path via API
    - think about programmatic building of walls and ramparts

    - defense creeps with attack bodyparts

    - harvest/tick
    - storage/tick
    - controller upgrade/tick
    - construction/tick

capture and control of another room
    - claimer creep
