X new role: miner (needs testing)
    X miner creep mines energy only
    X miner creep has specialized part template
    X add hauler role to pair with miner role
    X reassign miner to hauler if assigned dies

X new role: hauler (needs testing)
    X 1 per miner
    X assigned to a miner
    X picks up miner's dropped energy
    X deliver to base

X begin game with haulers acting as harvesters until miner creeps are made

X create single energy pickup point for upgraders and builders
    X change rest of creeps to pickup dropped energy

recovery system
    - add logic to build new basic creeps when all have been killed
    - add 'recovery' mode:
        1. create conditional for recovery state
        2. make less upgraders and builders
        3. upgrade creep more conservatively

do not create creeps besides miners and haulers until the pickup flag has energy on it

programmatic handling of upgrader, builder creep amount
    - naive solution: while pickup stockpile > x, make another creep

programmatic extension construction site placement
    - hardcode offset map from Spawn1

analytics system - get insights into:
    - harvest/tick
    - storage/tick
    - controller upgrade/tick
    - construction/tick

road building

tower building and logic

capture and control of another room
    - creep scout
    - capture
    - multi-room logic (refactor from single-room)
