road, walls, rampart building and maintenance
    X build roads based on calculated path via API
    X refactor road path model in room memory to persist
    X put only one construction site down at a time for builder creep focus
    - optimize road existance before trying to create construction site

multiple spawn bugs
    - creating too many haulers

think about programmatic building of walls and ramparts

programmatic extension construction site placement
    - hardcode offset map from Spawn1

DEFENSE, DEFENSE, DEFENSE
    - think about 'defense' mode
    - defense creeps with attack bodyparts

analytics system - get insights into:
    - harvest/tick
    - storage/tick
    - controller upgrade/tick
    - construction/tick

capture and control of another room
    - claimer creep
    - capture room
    - multi-room logic (refactor from single-room)
