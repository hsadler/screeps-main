X start thinking about logic-per-room architecture
    convert codebase to:
        X iterate through rooms and do per-room processes
        X do global processes (creep traveling between rooms, etc.)

road, walls, rampart building and maintenance
    - build road on path of haulers and upgraders (they should put down construction sites)
    - or build roads based on calculated path via API
    - think about programmatic building of walls and ramparts

DEFENSE, DEFENSE, DEFENSE
    - think about 'defense' mode
    - defense creeps with attack bodyparts

programmatic extension construction site placement
    - hardcode offset map from Spawn1

analytics system - get insights into:
    - harvest/tick
    - storage/tick
    - controller upgrade/tick
    - construction/tick

capture and control of another room
    - claimer creep
    - capture room
    - multi-room logic (refactor from single-room)
