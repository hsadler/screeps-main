better game info display
    X move to corner of room
    X bool constant for toggle
    - info: Summary of energy information: harvest/min, storage

creep evolution system
    X stub methods, interfaces
    X implement naive solution
    - suicide inferior creeps?

handle idle creeps
ideas:
    X flag system (idle creeps move to flag so that energy nodes are not blocked)
    - role system (idle creeps are given a new role)

new role: miner (needs testing)
    X miner creep mines energy only
    X miner creep has specialized part template
    X add hauler role to pair with miner role

new role: hauler (needs testing)
    X 1 per miner
    X assigned to a miner
    X picks up miner's dropped energy
    X deliver to base

analytics system - get insights into:
    - harvest/tick
    - storage/tick
    - controller upgrade/tick
    - construction/tick

    - multi-room logic (refactor from single-room)

renew/recycle system for creeps (maybe)
