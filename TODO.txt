creep evolution system
    X stub methods, interfaces
    X implement naive solution
    - suicide inferior creeps?

handle idle creeps
ideas:
    X flag system (idle creeps move to flag so that energy nodes are not blocked)
    - role system (idle creeps are given a new role)

new role: miner
    - miner creep mines energy only
    - miner creep has specialized part template
    - alter the 'harvest' mode of other creeps to transfer from the miner creeps

renew/recycle system for creeps

    - harvest/tick
    - storage/tick
    - controller upgrade/tick
